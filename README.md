# LocationETL Solution


1. Cleanup (Spark Job): A sample dataset of request logs is given in `DataSample.csv`. We consider records that have identical `geoinfo` and `timest` as suspicious. Please clean up the sample dataset by filtering out those suspicious request records.

2. Label (Spark Job): A list of POI (point of interest) locations is presented in `POIList.csv`. Please assign each request in the `DataSample.csv` to one of those POI locations that has minimum distance to the request location.

3. Analysis (Spark Job):
        -With respect to each POI location, please calculate the average and standard deviation of distance between the POI location to each of its assigned records.
        -Image to draw a circle which is centred at a POI location and includes all records assigned to the POI location. Please find out the radius and density (i.e. record count/circle area) for each POI location.
4. Model:
        -To visualize the popularity of the POI locations, we need to map the density of POIs into a scale from -10 to 10. Please give a mathematical model to implement the mapping. (Hint: please take consideration about extreme case/outliers, and aim to be more sensitive around mean average to give maximum visual differentiability.)
        -Bonus: try to come up with some reasonable hypotheses regarding POIs, state all assumptions, testing steps and conclusions. Include this as a text file (with a name `bonus`) in your final submission.
